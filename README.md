# What Time Is It Bot

A very simple Telegram Bot which tells you what time it is around the world. It is handy and useful inside international groups!

Just send ```/time``` followed by a country code or the name of a city, such as ```/time it``` or ```/time Rome``` to know the time in Italy.

* Timezone names are taken from [Geonames](http://download.geonames.org/export/)
